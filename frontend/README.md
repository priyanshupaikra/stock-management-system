## Setup
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

```
This will start the server and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
